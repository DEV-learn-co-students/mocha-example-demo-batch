# Node Hello World

## Objectives

1. Implement Hello World in Node
1. Run the script from the terminal


## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice how to run Node scripts from command line. In addition, you'll develop your first Node applicationâ€”Hello World, the traditional first app in any language.

## Instructions

1. Create file `hello-world.js` and open it in your favorite editor
2. Output "Hello World" with `console.log()` which works similarly to browser JavaScript, i.e., prints text.
3. Launch the script from command line / terminal / command prompt with `node hello-world` (`.js` is optional).
4. Observe the output
5. Install testing dependencies with `npm install`
6. Run tests with `npm test`

Tip: Don't overthink it.

### Extra Info

* [Console in Node official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/console.html)

## Solution

This is the content of `hello-world.js` which will pass the tests:

```js
console.log('Hello World')
```
